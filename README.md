* Download the .ipynb file from github
* Open the question4.ipynb file in google colab because google colab already have the libraries no need of doing Pip installing.
* Then run the code 
* This are the Steps done in this code
1.Importing the Libraries
2.Showing the MNIST data
3.Creating the model
4.fit and run the model
5.Evaluate the model
